# News Bias Classification: Encoder vs Decoder Models

This project focuses on analyzing and fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to classify political bias in text. The project includes various experiments with models such as RoBERTa and Gemma, along with prompt engineering techniques to improve classification performance.

This project uses both fine-tuning and prompt engineering methods for political bias classification in news articles. The experiments involve:

- Baseline and Fine-Tuning of two LLMS: RoBERTa (encoder-only) and Gemma-2b (decoder-only).
- Prompt Engineering to guide model outputs for bias detection.
- LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) as a PEFT technique to improve model efficiency during fine-tuning.

The best accuracy results for the selected dataset were 63\%-64\% with similar performance for the models, especially in the LoRA condition. Essentially, Gemma-2b can perform on par with RoBERTa for a given task, native for encoders.

# Limitations

 The systems tailored to classifying the political bias might suffer greatly from the lack of reliability or scalability. In particular, our system limitation is the spatially limited source of the data – the political environment of the USA. In the context of USA's politics, the distinction "left" or "right" might take the form of e.g. "pro-democrat" or "pro-republican", which loses scalability for other political contexts, outside of this environment.
